    "Monte Carlo simulations are often used to sample the canonical distribution (at a given temperature), given a potential energy surface.    \n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is one of the most popular sampling algorithms to generate a sequence of states.\n",
    "The sequence can be used to approximate the distribution and to calculate averages (e.g. the expected value of some observable at a given temperature).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is initialized by choosing (e.g., randomly) an initial state $x_0$ at $t=0$.\n",
    "Then, at each iteration:\n",
    "<ol>    \n",
    "  <li>We generate a new state $x'$ from a random distribution. In our example, we will consider a two-dimensional space, and move by a random amount along each of the two coordinates, where the random amount will be within a range $[-\\eta, \\eta]$ where $\\eta$ is the \"max move size\" that you can tune in the simulation.</li>\n",
    "  <li>We compute the energy of the new state.</li>\n",
    "  <ol>\n",
    "    <li>If the new state is lower in energy than the previous one, we accept it: $x_{t+1} = x'$;</li>\n",
    "    <li>If the new state is higher in energy than the previous one, accept it with a probability $\\delta = e^{-(E_{new} - E_{old})/(k_B T)}$ (then $x_{t+1} = x'$), otherwise reject it and store the old state ($x_{t+1} = x_t$);</li>\n",
    "    <li>In order to decide whether to accept or reject the state, we generate a random number $\\mu$ from a uniform distribution between [0, 1], and accept the move if $\\mu < \\delta$.</li>\n",
    "  </ol>\n",
    "  <li>We update the step index ($t \\rightarrow t+1$) and iterate until a given number of iterations is reached.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how we have two points in the algorithm where we generate random numbers: to generate a random move, and to decide whether to accept or reject a move with a given probability.\n",
