The objective function, sampling points and the reconstructed function are shown in plot 1 on the top left. The real part (coisine functions) and the constant term of the Fourier series is shown in plot 2 on the top right. Note that the components are shifted vertically for better visibility. The norm integral of the Fourier series with different $N_{\\text{fft}}$ is shown in plot at bottom where the current choice of sampling is labeled.
