    "        The wider the well potential is, the more (bound state) wavefunctions you will obtain. The reason for this can be traced back to the relationship between the eigenenergies of the bound states and the width of the well: $E_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$. Therefore, increasing the width of the well decreases the values of the various eigenergies. A different explanation for the decreased energy of the bound states with increasing well width can be found by appealing to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: the less confined a particle is (and thus the less certain we are of its position), the more certain we are of its momentum. This smaller spread in momentum values translates into smaller values for the particle's kinetic energy. In addition, there are consequently more states which satisfy $ E_n < V$ (where $V$ is the well depth) and this leads to an increase in the number of bound states.  \n",

    "        The deeper the well potential is, the more wavefunctions you will obtain. Mathematically, the explanation for this lies in the relationship between the values of the eigenergies and the potential depth. This is a transcendental relationship and has to be solved numerically or graphically but one may note that by increasing the well depth, the values of the various energy eigenvalues are increased.Some important remarks are that, regardless of the well depth, there is always at least one bound solution in one dimension and that as the depth is made progressively larger, the energy levels shall approach those of the infinite square well.

    "        When the dimension of the confining potential becomes comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of the confined particle then we begin to observe so-called confinement effects. These manifest as a discretization of the bound state energy levels (when the de Broglie wavelength and well width are not comparable the particle behaves essentially like a free particle, with a continuous energy spectrum). As mentioned in task 1, the relationship between the energy levels and the width of the well is $E_n \\propto \\frac{1}{L^2}$; consequently, as we decrease the width of the well, the spacing of the energy levels becomes larger and larger. As an application of this effect we note that in a nanostructure the effect of increased confinement (reducing the size of the structure) is to increase the band gap of that structure. This can be leveraged to manipulate the opto-electronic properties of the nanostructure. \n",
    "        Furthermore, we note that in a classical potential, the lowest energy state would be at the bottom of the well. In quantum mechanics, the lowest energy state has a higher energy \n",
    "        than the bottom of the quantum well, as you can see in the figure below. \n",
    "        The reason for this energy difference is what is typically called the quantum \n",
    "        confinement effect. Observe also how the lowest energy state changes with \n",
    "        the width of the well potential. \n",

    "    <summary style=\"color: red\">Solution</summary>\n",
    "       One can see that even although the potential outside the well is greater than the energy of the particle, there exists a non-zero probability of finding said particle at a position outside the well. This possibility of the particle \"tunnelling\" through the potential barrier in this way is a purely quantum mechanical effect. In the classical picture of this system one would never expect to observe the particle outside the confines of the potential well. \n",
