    "    In numerical analysis, the shooting method is a method for solving a boundary value problem by reformulating it as an initial value problem. Roughly speaking, we 'shoot' out trajectories in different directions from an initial value until we find a trajectory that has the desired boundary value. You can check out the following link for additional information on the method\n",
