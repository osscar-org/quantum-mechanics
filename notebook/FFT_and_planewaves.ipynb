    "The name \"plane wave\" originates from the fact that the wavefront (where the wave assumes the same value) is a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction $\\mathbf{q}$. \n",

    "The main advantage of this basis set is the possibility to use fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms to convert between the reciprocal-space representation (the coefficient of the plane waves) and the real-space representation of the wavefunctions on a grid. This is appealing because the operation of the potential on $\\psi$ is very simple in real space (since for local potentials it is simply an element-wise multiplication), while it is very efficient to compute the operation of the kinetic operator in reciprocal space, where the second derivative also becomes simply an element-wise multiplication. One can then pass between the two representations using FFTs, when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of plane waves (or, equivalently, of $\\mathbf G$ vectors) determines the size of the numerical problem to solve, it is important to find a balance between using enough plane waves to accurately represent the plane waves, but at the same time not too many, to avoid to make an overly expensive calculation.\n",
