    "The concept of the reciprocal space and reciprocal lattice was first introduced by [Paul Peter Ewald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Peter_Ewald) (German crystallographer and physicist) in 1921 [[Annalen der Physik, 369, 3, 253 (1921)]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19213690304). The concept of reciprocal space is very helpful to understand the X-ray diffraction. It is also one of the core concept in the solid state physics.\n",

    "The Wigner–Seitz construction is a method to build the primitive cell. In the reciprocal space, the Wigner-Seitze primitive cell is called the 1st Brillouin zone."
